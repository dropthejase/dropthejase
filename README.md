- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dropthejase, a beginner/intermediate programmer
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in using data science in business (particularly people analytics), as well as music app development (primarily around building music plugins). For now however, I'm focussed on levelling up my coding skills.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and SQL, but will look to add C++ to the list
